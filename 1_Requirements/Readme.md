# **Requirements**
## **Introduction**
The first things you do when you get into a vehicle is adjusting the temperature. Whether it’s too hot or too cold outside. We have used sensor which will sense whether driver is seated or not and if he is seated then they need to set the temperature accordingly. Based on that our controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and the display will show the temperature. Here we have used ATmega328 microcontroller along with switch pins, LED, etc. The System will sense whether driver is seated or not - The temperature can be altered by driver - Heater will generate the heat accordingly based on driver requirement. When electric current flows through it,the energy is turned into heat, which flows through the seat, warming the rider.

## **Features**
Customer can adjust the temperature as per his requirement.
Display the Temperature.

## **SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats**
### **Strengths**
The temperature can be modified inside the vehicles easily
Low cost system
### **Weakness**
It is applicable mostly for those countries which are having low temperature. 
### **Opportunities**
It can be implemented by having both Heater and AC. 
### **Threats**
Maintenance
## **4W’s and 1’H**
